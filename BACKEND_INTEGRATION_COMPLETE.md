# Backend Integration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Summary

Successfully connected the LexiChain frontend to the PostgreSQL database through Next.js API routes.

## What Was Built

### âœ… API Routes Created

1. **`/api/decks` (GET, POST)**
   - Fetch all decks with filtering (search, language, category)
   - Create new decks
   - Returns deck with card count and author info

2. **`/api/decks/[deckId]` (GET, PATCH, DELETE)**
   - Fetch single deck with all cards
   - Update deck details
   - Delete deck

3. **`/api/reviews` (GET, POST)**
   - Save review results with SM-2 algorithm
   - Fetch user's review history
   - Updates deck progress automatically

### âœ… Pages Connected to Database

1. **Dashboard (`/dashboard`)**
   - Fetches real decks from database
   - Shows loading state while fetching
   - Displays empty state if no decks
   - Shows deck count, language, and level

2. **Decks Library (`/decks`)**
   - Fetches all decks with real-time search and filtering
   - Shows loading spinner
   - Displays empty state with helpful message
   - Shows deck author, card count, and visibility status

3. **Study Session (`/study/[deckId]`)**
   - Fetches deck and cards from database
   - Saves review results to API after each card
   - Shows loading and error states
   - Web Speech API for pronunciation

### âœ… Features Implemented

- **Real-time Search & Filtering**: Search decks by title/description, filter by language
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading indicators on all pages
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages and fallbacks
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no data is available
- **Review Tracking**: Saves quality ratings and updates progress
- **Spaced Repetition**: Basic SM-2 algorithm implementation

## Database Schema

The app uses the following models:
- `User` - User accounts and learning stats
- `Deck` - Language learning decks
- `Card` - Flashcards with front/back/pronunciation/example
- `DeckProgress` - User progress per deck
- `Review` - SM-2 review history
- `Achievement` - User achievements

## How to Test

1. **Start PostgreSQL** (if not running):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

3. **Seed the database** (if not done):
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```

4. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev --filter=web
   ```

5. **Visit the app**:
   - Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   - Decks: http://localhost:3000/decks
   - Study: http://localhost:3000/study/[deckId]

## What's Next

The following features are ready to be built:

1. **Authentication** - NextAuth.js with email/password and wallet support
2. **Deck Management** - Create, edit, delete decks and cards
3. **Enhanced SM-2 Algorithm** - Full spaced repetition implementation
4. **Profile Page** - Connect to real user stats and achievements
5. **Blockchain Features** - EAS attestations for achievements
6. **IPFS Publishing** - Decentralized deck sharing

### API Response Format

**Deck List:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "cm4gvlj5i0001kgoilzs6yd0j",
    "title": "Spanish Basics",
    "description": "Essential Spanish vocabulary",
    "language": "Spanish",
    "level": "Beginner",
    "cardCount": 50,
    "isPublic": true,
    "author": {
      "id": "cm4gvlj5i0000kgoilzs6yd0i",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "image": null
    }
  }
]
```

**Deck with Cards:**
```json
{
  "id": "cm4gvlj5i0001kgoilzs6yd0j",
  "title": "Spanish Basics",
  "language": "Spanish",

### Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in `.env` or `packages/database/.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://lexichain:password@localhost:5435/lexichain"
```

## Notes

- Currently using a hardcoded user ID for testing (will be replaced with auth)
- Search and filtering are done both client-side and server-side
- Review intervals are simplified (will be enhanced with full SM-2)
- All API routes include error handling and validation
